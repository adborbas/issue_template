### Coding Guideline

ðŸš§ _Currently under construction and will be updated in the future. The guide is only applicable for Go based steps. Please follow to conventions of the existing code for Ruby and Bash based steps._

This section is intended to describe the coding conventions applied for the step. Please refer to it when contributing code to the repository.

Our single guide currently is to apply [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html), which has a great number of tips on writing clear, idiomatic Go code.
